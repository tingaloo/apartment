This application is a Rails mockup to ApartmentTherapy.com

I wanted to build a quick prototype of a standard blog format with the site's usability and functionality in mind.

I still need to add categories, search form, and slowly make the site single-page. An image handler hosted on S3 would be useful.

I do not know how current users enter data, but I figured using a WYSIWYG editor would streamline the blogging process.
